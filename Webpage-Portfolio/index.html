        <h2> Lawrence's Story </h2>
          <p> I am a software developer living in Orlando, Fl with plans to see the world and hopes to make a positive change. Nothing excites me more than meeting new people and I cannot wait to collaborate with as many as possible in this amazing community. 
          </p>

          <p> My areas of interests are: 
          </p>

            <!-- create an unordered list of list items -->
            <ul>
              <li> Cybersecurity/Hacking </li>
              <li> Android App Development </li>
              <li> Web Development </li>
           </ul>
      
           <p> A 15-year career in the hospitality industy afforded many opportunites to engage with people from every walk of life and a wide range of cuisines. I developed a genuine love for both through those experiences. Researching recipes and cultures can lead to parts of the world one did not know existed. 
          </p> 

            <p>One day realized that my destiny was in the Information Technology industry. Joining Thinkful was one of the best decisions I ever made. The feelings of motivation and satisfaction are incredible. I look forward to each day in the program.
