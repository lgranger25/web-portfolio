          <h2> Lawrence's Story </h2>
            <p> I am a Kitchen Manager by day and a Webpage Developer/NFT Creator by night living in Orlando, Fl. </p>
            <p> I hope to make a positive change through my creations and interactions. </p>
            <p> I always enjoy meeting new people and I cannot wait to communicate with as many as possible in this amazing community. 
            </p>

            <p> My favorite topics are as follows: 
            </p>

            <!-- create an unordered list of list items -->
            <ul>
              <li> Marvel Movies and TV Shows </li>
              <li> Diverse Cuisines and Recipes </li>
              <li> NFTs & Crypto </li>
              <li> Android App Development </li>
              <li> Web Development </li>
           </ul>
      
            <p> A 15-year career in the hospitality industry afforded many opportunites to engage with people from every walk of life, the young and old, those from far and near, the wealthy and the just getting-by. </p>
            <p> Researching recipes and cultures has lead me to parts of the world I did not know existed.  
            </p> 

            <p> Recently, I made the choice to pursue all the dreams and goals I have amassed over the years. For too long, procrastination has been the main obstacle to my success and acheivements. </p>
            <p> These feelings of motivation and satisfaction are incredible. I genuinely do not remember the last time I felt this way, but am extremely grateful and look forward to how far it will take me. </p>
